# NeuralNetCar4
A locally-running, web-specific, DNN+RL autonomous obstacle avoidance agent.
All code files are prepared and should be placed within the same folder hierarchy. Please place them inside a folder named "NeuralNetCar4".
A virtual environment is required, and libraries such as TensorFlow need to be installed.

Folder structure:
NeuralNetCar4/
├── index.html  
├── simulation.js  
├── main_server_refactored.py  
(venv) folder included  
The weights are stored in the “model” folder.

Example of command-line execution (first, navigate into the folder hierarchy):
C:
cd \---------\NeuralNetCar4

Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install Required Libraries
pip install tensorflow numpy

Execute:
python main_server_refactored.py

Open the HTML file in a browser:
file:///C:/---------/NeuralNetCar4/index.html

To stop the process:
Press Ctrl+C
Do not press it multiple times. Wait patiently without panicking.
